                        " Speaking on the essentials of human greatness wonders, the historian Lamar Tine states: If greatness of purpose, smallness of means and astounding results are the three criteria of human genius, who could dare to compare any great man in modern history
                        than Muhammad. The most famous men created arms, laws and empires only. They founded, if anything at all, no more than material powers which often crumbled away before their eyes. This man moved not only armies, legislation, empires,
                        peoples and dynasties, but millions of men in one-third of the then inhabited world; and more than that, he moved the altars, the gods, the religions, the ideas, the beliefs and souls…. His forbearance in victory, his ambition,
                        which was entirely devoted to one idea and in no manner striving for an empire; His endless prayers, his mystic conversations with God, his death and his triumph after death; all these attest not to an imposture but to a firm conviction
                        which gave him the power to restore a dogma. Philosopher, orator, apostle, legislator, warrior, conqueror of ideas, restorer of rational dogmas, of a cult without images, the founder of twenty terrestrial empires and of one spiritual
                        empire, that is Muhammad. As regards all the standards by which human greatness may be measured, we may well ask, ‘Is there any man greater than he?"
